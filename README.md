# Step-by-step to Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation Solution



### prerequisite:

Here is one nice blog for pgvector on Amazon RDS and SageMaker
[Building AI-powered search in PostgreSQL using Amazon SageMaker and pgvector](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/building-ai-powered-search-in-postgresql-using-amazon-sagemaker-and-pgvector/) Following the CloudFormation, you should have all infrastructure set up. 

### step by step to build the solution

Please use the pre-configured notebook named "NotebookInstance-******" located under the SageMaker Notebook instances. This notebook is already set up with a connection to PostgreSQL, enabling you to run it directly.
